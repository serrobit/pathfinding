## Pathfinding Visualization in Java

A Java Swing & AWT based application that visualizes pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm and the A* algorithm. The application features a grid with a starting cell (green) and ending cell (red) which the user can control independently using the WASD and Arrow keys respectively. Also, the user may draw wall cells using the left mouse button, or automatically generated a depth-first search random maze.
